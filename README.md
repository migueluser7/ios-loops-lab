***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// this code will run forever, the while condition is that it will run while the variable i is greater than 3, the variable i already has a value of 5 to start so it is greater than 3 so the while condition starts off as true and will run the statement inside it which will add +1 to the variable i thus increasing the variable i. because of this, the loop will never end
```

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// THE ANSWER IS

var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
    if i == 9 {
        break
    }
}
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// THE ANSWER IS


var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
    if i == 1006{
        break
    }
}
```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// THE ANSWER IS


var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
    if i % 2 == 0{
        print(i)
    }
    if i == 1006{
        break
    }
}
```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10


// THE ANSWER IS

they will output the same output, while confusing at first, it is easy to comprehend these loops, the first loop will perform the code in the brackets while the condition is true, the second loop will execute the code inside the repeat bracket as long as the condition in the while is true, similar and the same all at once
```

    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }

## Question 4

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```

***
## Question 5

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 6

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 7

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 8

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
